<h2 align='center'>Hello ðŸ‘‹! I am Ritvik Nimmagadda.</h2> 

<p align = 'center'>
  I am a College Senior mainly interested in interdisciplinary research involving Machine Learning. 
  My interest lies in research in the sphere of Deep Learning and Computer Vision, however, I am open to exploring other areas of Machine Learning too. 
  I have always been fascinated by the power of Artificial Intelligence and its wonders. 
  My fondness towards Mathematics and Computer Science since my childhood days pushed me to work on Machine Learning. 
  My first research work in this field was "Advanced Meta-Heuristic Approaches for Automatic License Plate Corner Point Detection", where I worked on improving the performance and accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning models used for object detection tasks by performing feature selection on these models using various nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms like Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Cuckoo Search Algorithm. This paper has been accepted to the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Theory and Applications (AITA 2021) and is going to be published in SCOPUS Indexed book series Lecture Notes (Springer).
  Later, I got a chance to intern at the Ontario Tech University, where I was a part of the project "Emotion Recognition Models for Companion Robots". I worked on building machine learning models for the task of Audio Based Emotion Recognition using a MultiModal approach to be used in companion robots. We submitted this paper
  to The Journal of Supercomputing.
  I wish to opt for Higher Studies in related Graduate Programs to work on some concrete research to feed my curiosity in my areas of interest.
  Five years from now, I see myself publishing impactful independent research work, making a meaningful contribution in my field.
