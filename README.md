<h2 align='center'>Hello ðŸ‘‹! I am Ritvik Nimmagadda.</h2> 

<p align = 'center'>
  I am a CS graduate student at the University of Southern California, mainly interested in interdisciplinary research involving machine learning. 
  My interest lies in research in the spheres of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. However, I am open to exploring other areas of Machine Learning too. 
  I have always been fascinated by the power of artificial intelligence and its wonders. 
  My fondness for mathematics and computer science since my childhood days pushed me to work on machine learning. 
  My first research work in this field was "Advanced Meta-Heuristic Approaches for Automatic License Plate Corner Point Detection", where I worked on improving the performance and accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning models used for object detection tasks by performing feature selection on these models using various nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms like Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Cuckoo Search Algorithm. I presented this paper at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Theory and Applications (AITA 2021).
  Later, I got a chance to intern at Ontario Tech University, where I was a part of the project "Emotion Recognition Models for Companion Robots." I worked on building machine learning models for the task of audio-based emotion recognition using a multi-modal approach to be used in companion robots. This paper was published in the Journal of Supercomputing.
  Five years from now, I see myself developing applications and publishing impactful research work, making a meaningful contribution in my field.
